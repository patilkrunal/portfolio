                In my free time, I don't really do much. I like to relax
                through browsing reddit or sleeping. Honestly, this section
                could end here, I don't really do much; but that would be too
                boring... and empty.

                Seriously! When I am feeling motivated, I play around with

                evidence for that! I recently discovered the JAMStack and its
                benefits. I created this current GatsbyJS version amidst the
                pandemic and quarantine affair, to see the advantages for
                myself. Sure enough, Gatsby delivered! Get started with

                taste in things. I basically just go with my current mood and
                what I feel like watching, listening or reading. Nevertheless,
                here are timeless favoritesâ€” no matter what mood or location,
                I'm always down for them.
                <br />
                <br />
                For movies, I love going back to Middle Earth and root for the
                best hobbit in the world, Samwise Gamgee. One could never go
                wrong with Lord of the Rings trilogy (extended verions
                please). I truly adore the lore of the Middle Earth, and the
                efforts that JRR Tolkien dedicated in the world building.
                Although the movies are great adaptations, I still like going
                back and reading The Lord of the Rings novels.
                <br />
                <br />
                I am a sucker for the fantasy genre. My favorite literary work
                is A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin. I love how the
                characters are written to reflect humanity in real life, with
                grey morality in characters and complexities in politics. For
                manga, I highly recommend Shingeki No Kyojin.
                <br />
                <br />
                For music, the only album I could listen to on repeat forever
                would be In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel.
                To be honest, I don't fully understand the whole album, but
                it's an amazing auditory experience. A close runner up would
                be the self titled album of GUNSHIP to accompany late night
                existential thoughts.
                <br />
                <br />
                Speaking of existential thoughts, I believe Neon Genesis
                Evangelion delivers that with its exploration in human psyche
                and emotions. It seems like a mecha early on, but I promise,
                it is a beautiful melancholic slow burn. Like Breaking Bad!
                Such a well-crafted show worth the patience and occasional fly
                swatting attempts. Better Call Saul, its prequel spin-off
                series, is also exceptional.

                  Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
                </h3>

                It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.
                Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so
                wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to
                create lifeâ€¦ He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he
                could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
                <br />
                <br />
                The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some
                consider to be unnatural. He became so powerfulâ€¦ the only
                thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually,
                of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
                everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his
                sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not
                himself.
